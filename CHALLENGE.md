## Data Structure

### TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
// Individual conversation data point
interface DataEntry {
  companySize: 'Startup (1-10)' | 'Small (11-50)' | 'Medium (51-200)' | 'Large (201-1000)' | 'Enterprise (1000+)';
  industry: 'E-Commerce' | 'Media & Marketing' | 'Finance & Banking' | 'SaaS & Technology' | 'Education' | 'Consulting';
  quarter: '2024-Q1' | '2024-Q2' | '2024-Q3' | '2024-Q4';
  responseValue: string; // e.g., "Google Workspace", "REST API Access", "Too Expensive"
  numResponses: number;  // How many times this was mentioned
}

// Question structure  
interface Question {
  questionId: 'q1' | 'q2' | 'q3';
  questionNumber: number;
  question: string;
  questionType: 'multi_response';
  description: string;
  data: DataEntry[];
}

// Root data structure
interface HubSpotData {
  metadata: {
    title: string;
    total_conversations: number;
    date_range: string;
  };
  uniqueValues: {
    companySize: string[];
    industry: string[];  
    quarter: string[];
  };
  questions: Question[];
}
```

### Data Overview

**Pick ONE question to visualize** (you don't need all three):

- **Q1 - Current Tools**: "Google Workspace", "Microsoft 365", "Slack", "Notion", "Airtable", "Monday.com"
- **Q2 - Requirements**: "REST API Access", "Zapier Integration", "HubSpot Integration", "Webhooks", "Competitive Pricing"  
- **Q3 - Concerns**: "Too Expensive", "Data Privacy & Security", "Lack of Integrations", "Poor Customer Support"

**Key Points**:
- Data is pre-aggregated (each `DataEntry` represents summed conversation data)
- Filter by dimensions: company size, industry, quarter
- Chart shows `responseValue` vs total `numResponses`

### Quick Implementation Example

```typescript
// Load and process data
import _ from 'lodash';

const processChartData = (questionData: DataEntry[], filters: FilterState) => {
  const filtered = questionData.filter(entry => 
    filters.companySize.includes(entry.companySize) &&
    filters.industry.includes(entry.industry) &&
    filters.quarter.includes(entry.quarter)
  );

  // Aggregate by responseValue
  const aggregated = _(filtered)
    .groupBy('responseValue')
    .mapValues(group => _.sumBy(group, 'numResponses'))
    .entries()
    .sortBy(1)
    .reverse()
    .value();

  return {
    labels: aggregated.map(([label]) => label),
    values: aggregated.map(([, value]) => value)
  };
};

// Chart.js configuration
const chartConfig = {
  type: 'bar',
  data: {
    labels: chartData.labels,
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Mentions',
      data: chartData.values,
      backgroundColor: 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.8)'
    }]
  },
  options: {
    indexAxis: 'y', // Horizontal bars
    responsive: true,
    plugins: {
      title: { 
        display: true, 
        text: 'Top Tools - Enterprise Q4 2024' 
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## About Page Requirements üéØ

**This is critical for evaluation** - your About page should include:

### Required Sections

**1. Progress & Time Breakdown**
```markdown
## What I Completed
‚úÖ Nuxt setup, data loading, basic Chart.js bar chart for Q1 data
‚ö†Ô∏è Company size filtering (works but has rendering bug)  
‚ùå Industry filtering, responsive design

## Time Spent
- Hour 1: Setup + Chart.js installation
- Hour 2: Chart component + data aggregation (TypeScript issues)
- Hour 3: Company size filter implementation  
- Hour 4: Bug fixing + this documentation
```

**2. Prioritization Decisions**
- What you focused on first and why
- Trade-offs you made given time constraints

**3. Next Steps**  
- Concrete next features you'd implement
- How you'd improve what you built
- What you'd refactor

**4. Challenges & Solutions**
- Technical blockers you encountered
- How you solved them (or didn't)
- What you learned

**5. Technical Decisions**
- Component architecture choices
- State management approach  
- Libraries used and alternatives considered

### Example About Content

```markdown
## Progress Made

### Completed Features
- ‚úÖ Basic Nuxt 3 setup with TypeScript
- ‚úÖ Chart.js bar chart displaying Q1 data (Current Tools)  
- ‚úÖ Company size dropdown filter (mostly working)
- ‚úÖ Data aggregation logic using Lodash

### Partially Working  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Chart re-renders with filter changes but has flickering bug
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Filter state persists but doesn't show selected value correctly

### Not Started
- ‚ùå Industry and quarter filtering  
- ‚ùå Loading states and error handling
- ‚ùå Responsive design optimization

## Time Breakdown & Prioritization

**Hour 1**: Nuxt setup + Chart.js integration (45 minutes with AI assistance)
**Hour 2**: Chart component + data processing (longer than expected due to TypeScript config)  
**Hour 3**: Filter implementation (got basic company size working)
**Hour 4**: Bug fixing + documentation

**Why I chose Q1 data**: Current tools seemed most business-relevant and had clear, recognizable values like "Slack" and "Google Workspace" that would make for an intuitive chart.

**Why company size first**: Only 5 options vs 6 industries, seemed simpler to implement and debug.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Fix chart flickering bug** - Chart re-creates instead of updating data
2. **Add industry filtering** - Similar dropdown pattern to company size  
3. **Improve filter UI** - Show selected values, clear filters button
4. **Add quarter filtering** - Complete the multi-dimensional filtering
5. **Loading states** - Show spinner while processing data
6. **Responsive design** - Mobile-friendly layout

## Challenges Encountered

**Chart.js TypeScript Configuration**: Spent 30 minutes on import/type issues. AI helped but took multiple iterations to get Chart.js + Vue 3 + TypeScript working together.

**Reactive Data Updates**: Initial approach caused chart to completely re-render on filter changes. Need to research Chart.js `.update()` method for smooth transitions.

**Data Processing Logic**: Took time to understand the pre-aggregated structure. Initially tried to process individual conversations before realizing data was already summed.

## Technical Decisions

**Component Architecture**: 
- Single Chart component with reactive props for reusability
- Filter logic in parent component (would extract to composable for scalability)  
- Used Lodash for data aggregation (cleaner than vanilla JS reduce)

**State Management**: 
- Simple reactive refs in parent component
- Considered Pinia but seemed overkill for this scope
- Would move to composable for production

**Libraries Chosen**:
- Lodash over pandas-js (more familiar, smaller bundle)
- Chart.js over D3 (faster to implement, good enough for requirements)
- Tailwind default classes only (no custom CSS to save time)

## What I'd Do Differently

Given more time, I'd:
- Start with composable architecture from the beginning
- Set up proper Chart.js update patterns before adding filters  
- Create reusable filter components for DRY code
- Add proper TypeScript throughout (some any types used for speed)
```
